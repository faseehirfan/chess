## Key Features
The key features that we have implemented into our chess game are as follows:

### 1) Chess Game Mechanics
- Piece Movement: We developed the game mechanics so that each type of piece (Pawn, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, and King) follows the standard rules in chess.
- Special Movement: Our implementation allows users to perform moves such as en passant, castling, and pawn promotion.
- Check Detection: The game can detect checks and prevents users from making moves that result in themselves getting checked.
- Checkmate/Stalemate Detection: The game can detect scenarios in which a checkmate or stalemate is reached and updates the score accordingly.
- Multiplayer Logic: We implemented game logic that manages turn-taking between two players, and also incorporated a scoring system.
  
### 2) CLI Commands
- Simple Commands: Users are able to interact with and use the program using simple commands through the text-based interface.
- Custom Setup: Players are also able to play the game using a customized board, where each player chooses the pieces and their locations on the board.
- Text and Graphics-based Displays
- Text-based Display: We effectively implemented a visually clear text-based display and interface, allowing the player to play chess in the command line environment.
- Graphics-based Display: We created a graphical interface using X11 with pieces represented as letters, improving the playersâ€™ experience from the text-based display.
  
### 3) Non-Human Player
- Computer Player: The game includes move generation logic to allow human players to play against computer players of varying difficulties.
- Multi-level Options: We implemented four difficulty levels for the computer player, each with more sophisticated move generation than the last:
- Level One: Random valid move from a random piece is chosen.
- Level Two: Prioritizes capturing moves and checks over other moves.
- Level Three: Prioritizes avoiding capture, capturing moves, and checks.
- Level Four: Prioritizes capturing moves that capture pieces worth a higher number of points, avoiding capture, and checks.

### 4) Error Handling
- Error Consideration: We considered cases where errors may arise and make sure that the program effectively and appropriately handles all errors.
- Testing: Our group produced both unit tests and integration tests for every case (including edge cases) to ensure that our program covered all possibilities.
- Extra Credit Features
- Undo Move: The game allows for an unlimited number of undos until the starting state of the board, while managing the turn system accordingly.
